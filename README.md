# EWC Ansible Role EUMETSAT S3 Mount

This repository contains a configuration template 
(i.e. an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)) 
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

The template is designed to provide:
* A secure, idempotent, and production-grade way to mount read-only EUMETSAT data buckets as `FUSE` filesystems on EWC compute instances running RockyLinux or Ubuntu.

## Features

- Self-service access to EUMETSAT data publicly available within the EWC (no credentials required)
- User-defined mounting location and configurable idle timeout
- Strict file permissions for mounted directories
- Boot-safe design; does not block boot on `S3` outage
- Advanced per-bucket cache/refresh tuning (via tweaking of included defaults)

## Usage

The step-by-step described below assume your local file system follows the example structure below, with `ewc-ansible-role-eumetsat-s3-mount` being a clone of this repository:

```
.
├── roles
│   └── ewc-ansible-role-eumetsat-s3-mount
├── inventory.yml
└── playbook.yml
```

### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:
```yaml
# inventory.yml
---
ewcloud:
  hosts:
    ewc_host:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
      ansible_user: <add the username which owns the SSH private key >
```

### 2. Customize the template

Edit input values for the template [variables](./vars/main.yml) as needed (see
[Inputs](#inputs) section for details).
Then, proceed to create an Ansible Playbook file to load your customizations: 

```yaml
# playbook.yml
---
- name: Mount EUMETSAT S3 buckets
  hosts: ewc_host
  become: true
  become_user: root
  become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo

  roles:
    - ewc-ansible-role-eumetsat-s3-mount
```

### 3. Apply the template


You can apply changes on the target host by running:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

## Inputs

| Name |  Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| eumetsat_mount_root | Root directory where all S3 buckets will be mounted (read-only). Example: `/mnt/eumetsatdata` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| allow_other | Allow non-root access to the mounted directories. Only `yes` will be accepted to approve. Example: `yes` | `string`| n/a | yes |
| vfs_cache_mode | Cache mode. Setting as `minimal` is recommended for read-only EO data. Example: `minimal` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| vfs_cache_max_size | Max cache size. Example: `512Mi` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| automount_enabled | Use on-demand automount (recommended). Only `yes` will be accepted to approve. Example: `yes`  | `string` |  n/a | yes |
| automount_timeout_idle_seconds | Idle timeout (in seconds) after which an automount will be unmounted. Example: `600` | `integer` | n/a | yes |
